# Foobar

Bootstrap portfolio is my attempt of recreating my original portfolio incorporating elements from bootstrap. I have also taken the opportunity to try to address some of the feedback I received regarding my initial page layout. I updated the nav bar to make it responsive and included a drop down menu. In addition I created a Jumbotron as a place holder until I find a desired image and replaced my word tiles with cards. Overall I found this to be challenging but I am happy with the result and ultimately highlighted how bootstrap can be used as a staple tool in my workflow going forward.
